# 📘 Splunk Learning Repository

This repository documents my journey of learning **Splunk**.

I will be creating and uploading **small beginner-level projects** using Splunk, organized into separate folders for each project. These projects focus on hands-on learning, practice, and understanding core Splunk concepts such as log analysis, searches, and dashboards.

This repository will be updated regularly as I continue learning and building projects with Splunk.
